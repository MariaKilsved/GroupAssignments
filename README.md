# GroupAssignment 1
## Objective
You are going to code a simple wine cellar where you keep track of your favorite wines.
You want to be able to add wines to the cellar, keep track of the number of wines and print
out the content of cellar. 

When you add wines to your cellar, a confirmation should be written to the console.
If you try to add more wine bottles than your cellar can handle an error message should
instead be written.

### Mandatory:
-   Work in your assigned group 
-   Clone the repository https://github.com/smarlen/GroupAssignments.git
-   Complete the code in the methods StringToPrint, InsertWine, PrintWines, NrOfBottles in repository 

The code in Main() should generate below output to the console.

    My cellar can have maximum 4 bottles
    Added to my cellar: Wine 2000 Château Lafite Rothschild is made of CabernetSauvignon from Bordeaux
    Added to my cellar: Wine 2010 Domaine de la Romanée-Conti is made of PinotNoir from Burgundy
    Added to my cellar: Wine 2005 Giuseppe Quintarelli Amarone is made of Corvina from Veneto
    Added to my cellar: Wine 2008 Sierra Cantabria is made of Tempranillo from RiberaDelDuero
    Could NOT add to my cellar: Wine 1992 Screaming Eagle is made of Cabernet Sauvignon from RiberaDelDuero
  
    My cellar has 4 wines:
    Wine 2000 Château Lafite Rothschild is made of CabernetSauvignon from Bordeaux
    Wine 2010 Domaine de la Romanée-Conti is made of PinotNoir from Burgundy
    Wine 2005 Giuseppe Quintarelli Amarone is made of Corvina from Veneto
    Wine 2008 Sierra Cantabria is made of Tempranillo from RiberaDelDuero

### Challenge (if you like to try):
-   Add a Method that search for the first wine whose name contains a certain string.
For example, searching for “Cantabria” should find the last wine in the cellar above.
The Method should return true or false depending on search success.
-   Add a Method that deletes a wine with a certain name. The Method should return
true or false depending on search success.

### Report:
-   Hand in your group work with the names and participants in the group mentioned as
comments in the code at the deadline given. Hand in either as zip file or as a git link
repository.
-   Each member in the group, send me a short separate email on your experience of the
groupwork
